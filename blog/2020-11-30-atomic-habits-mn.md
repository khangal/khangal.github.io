# Translation in Progress

## Яагаад бага өөрчлөлтүүд төм үр дүн авчирдаг вэ.
- Зуршил нь хүүтэй сайжралт юм. Өдөр бүр 1 хувь сайжрах нь ирээдүйд маш их
  өөрчлөлт авчирна.

- Зуршил нь 2 талтай сэлэм юм. Зуршил таны талд, эсвэл эсрэг ажилж болно. Иймд
  зуршлийн талаар тодорхой ойлголттой байх нь чухал юм.

- Жижиг өөрчлөлтүүд чухал босгыг давтлаа мэдрэгдэхгүй. Хүүтэй явцын өгөөж нь
  хойш тавигддаг. Та тэвчээртэй байх хэрэгтэй.

- Том өөрчлөлтийн суурь нь жижиг зуршилууд юм.

- Хэрвээ та илүү дээр үр дүн хүсч байгаа бол зорилго тавихаа хойш тавиад, систем
  дээрээ илүү анхаарах хэрэгтэй.

- Та зорилгынхоо өндөррүү өгсдөггүй_ Харин системийнхаа өндөррүү унадаг.

## Хэрхэн зуршил таны identity-г бүрэлдүүлдэг вэ. (мөн эсрэгээрээ)

- 3-н төрлийн өөрчлөлт байдаг: outcome change, process change, and identity change.

- Зуршилаа өөрчлөхөд хамгийн үр нөлөөтэй өөрлөлт бол ямар зорилгод хүрэх биш хэн болохыг хүсэх юм.

- Таны зуршилаас, таны identity урган гарч ирдэг. Хийж байгаа үйлдэл болгон хэн
  болмоор байгаад тэр хүнд өгч байгаа санал юм.

- Өөрийнхөө хамгийн сайнаар байх нь танаас үргэлж итгэл үнэмшлээ өөрчлөх,
  identity-гаа тэлэхийг шаарддаг.

- Зуршил чухал гэдгийн жинхэнэ шалтгаан нь илүү үр дүнд хүрэх биш (хүрэх ч гэсэн), харин зуршилаар та өөрийнхөө хэн гэдгийг өөрчилж чаддаг учраас.

## 4-н алхмаар хэрхэн илүү сайн зуршилтай болох вэ.

- Үйлдэл хангалттай олон удаа давтагдсанаар, автомат болох нь зуршил юм.

- Зуршилийн гол зорилго нь асуудлыг хамгийн бага хүч хөдөлмөр зарцуулах шийдэхэд
  оршино.

- Ямар ч зуршил 4-н шатад, хуваагдаж болно. Дохио, шунал, үйлдэл, болон шагнал.

- Зуршил тогтоох 4-н хууль, (1) илэрхий болгох, (2) сонирхолтой болгох, (3) амархан болгох, (4) сэтгэлд ханамжтай болгох.

# 1-р хууль: Илэрхий болгох

<!-- ## The Man Who Didn’t Look Right -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## The Best Way to Start a New Habit -->
<!-- - The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The two most common cues are time and location. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More -->
<!-- - Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## The Secret to Self-Control -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## How to Make a Habit Irresistible -->
<!-- - The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits -->
<!-- - The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # The 3rd Law: Make it Easy -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Walk Slowly, but Never Backward -->
<!-- - The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Focus on taking action, not being in motion. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## The Law of Least Effort -->
<!-- - Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Prime your environment to make future actions easier. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule -->
<!-- - Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible -->
<!-- - The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # The 4th Law: Make it Satisfying -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change -->
<!-- - The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day -->
<!-- - One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything -->
<!-- - The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # ADVANCED TACTICS How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t) -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## The Downside of Creating Good Habits -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. -->
